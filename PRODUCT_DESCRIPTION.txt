            FEATURE 4: SPECIALIST SUBSCRIPTION SYSTEM
================================================================================

Overview
--------
A comprehensive role-based access control and subscription management system
that governs user permissions for games, scales, and platform features. This
system enables flexible monetization, controlled feature access, and specialized
roles for different user types.

User Roles & Access Levels
---------------------------
The platform supports four primary user roles:

1. ADMIN
   - Full platform access
   - User and specialist management
   - Complete access to all 52 games
   - Complete access to all 7 scales
   - Analytics and reporting
   - System configuration
   - Permission assignment capabilities

2. SPECIALIST
   - Professional therapist/educator role
   - Access based on role permissions configuration
   - Can view assigned client cases
   - Conduct virtual therapy sessions
   - Review assessment results
   - Session note management
   - May have full or limited game/scale access based on clinic policy

3. PAID USER / SUBSCRIBED USER
   - Premium parent/caregiver account
   - Full access to all 52 educational games
   - Full access to all 7 assessment scales
   - Unlimited child profiles
   - Advanced reporting and progress tracking
   - Priority booking for specialist sessions
   - No ads or promotional content

4. REGULAR USER (Free Tier)
   - Limited access based on assigned permissions
   - Restricted game library (admin-defined subset)
   - Restricted scale access
   - Basic child profile management
   - Standard booking capabilities
   - Incentivized to upgrade to paid subscription

Subscription Features
---------------------
• isSubscribed flag on user profile
• Automatic permission elevation when subscribed
• Override of role-based restrictions for paid users
• Subscription status visible in user management interface
• Admin can manually toggle subscription status

Permission System Architecture
------------------------------
The system employs a sophisticated multi-layer permission model:

Layer 1: Role-Based Permissions
- Each role has default game/scale permissions
- Stored in Firestore 'permissions' collection
- Centrally managed by administrators
- Applies to all users of that role

Layer 2: User-Specific Permissions
- Individual users can have custom game/scale arrays
- Stored directly on UserProfile document
- Overrides role-based permissions when present
- Examples:
  * gamePermissions: [1, 5, 10, 15]  // Access to only these 4 games
  * scalePermissions: [1, 3, 7]       // Access to only these 3 scales

Layer 3: Time-Limited Access
- Support for expiring permissions
- gameAccessExpires: Date field on user profile
- scaleAccessExpires: Date field on user profile
- When expiry date passes, user-specific permissions ignored
- Reverts to role-based permissions after expiry
- Enables trial periods and temporary access grants

Permission Resolution Logic
---------------------------
When determining if a user can access a game or scale:

1. Check if user is Admin or isSubscribed → Grant full access
2. Check if user.gamePermissions exists and not expired
   → Use user-specific permissions
3. Fall back to role-based permissions from permissions collection
4. If no permissions found → Deny access (empty array)

This cascading model ensures flexibility for:
- Free trials with automatic expiration
- Temporary specialist access grants
- Promotional access campaigns
- Gradual feature rollout to user segments

Technical Implementation
------------------------
• UserProfile interface with subscription fields
• PermissionService with Observable-based access control
• Firebase Firestore for permission storage
• Real-time permission updates via Firebase listeners
• Permission caching for performance
• Angular route guards for access enforcement:
  * PaidUserGuard - Requires subscription or 'user' role
  * SpecialistGuard - Requires 'specialist' role
  * Admin guard - Requires 'admin' role

Subscription Management Interface
----------------------------------
Admin users have access to user management tools including:
• View all users in table format
• See subscription status column
• Toggle subscription checkbox per user
• Update role assignments
• View and edit custom permissions
• Set permission expiry dates
• Export user lists and reports

Billing Integration (Future)
-----------------------------
The subscription system is designed to integrate with:
• Stripe or local payment providers
• Automated subscription renewal
• Trial period management
• Dunning and payment retry logic
• Invoice generation
• Revenue analytics
